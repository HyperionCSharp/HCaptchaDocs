# About Hcaptcha
Hcaptcha is a anti bot verification system that prevents malicious bots from abusing online services.
- hCaptcha combined advanced self-supervised machine learning with a novel edge compute approach that uniquely minimizes data collection and retention, delivered from over 250 locations globally for massive scalability.
- hCaptcha is designed to eliminate long-term data retention by relying on instant evaluation rather than recording and analyzing your browsing history.

## They also did some real world AI ethics study here is the info from that
- Human beings are pattern-seekers, and sometimes an innocuous question can go from entirely unsurprising to suspicious in an instant, due to changes in the world rather than the motivations of anyone asking the question. As services become more popular, this sort of occurrence inevitably becomes more frequent. hCaptcha is used by millions of people each day in virtually every country in the world, so we are publishing this policy and a case study on how we address these issues in order to be as transparent as possible.
- “Umbrella” is a term in ImageNet, the standard benchmark dataset used by computer vision researchers. Reliably identifying people holding umbrellas is also critical for building safe next-generation advanced driver assistance (ADAS) systems. This means there are excellent use cases for real-world umbrella annotations. There is room for disagreement on the impact of self-driving cars, but ADAS systems are already saving thousands of lives each year around the world.
